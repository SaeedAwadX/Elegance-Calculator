I developed such application to improve my coding skills, it's a calculator with a neat interface.

I used a black CASIO HL-815L style as an interface at the beginning, and it looked so pretty specially with the Form Reshaper code running which makes selected sections of the form transperant during run-time.

I contacted CASIO regarding this calculator and I was informed that using CASIO interface is only allowed in case of personal use, I didn't code this calculator to use it! I did to improve my codig skills and to share the code with other devs, and CASIO informed me that sharing their logo is law infringement, infringing the law is the last thing that I want.

I never thought that coding a calculator would be so challenging, I recommend you to check it out guys.

I've done everything on a rush so it might contain bugs, please contact me if you find any.

I'm not a Photoshop expert and the interface I designed is a normalone so please contact me if you find/know any calculator image (a free one) so I could use as an interface.

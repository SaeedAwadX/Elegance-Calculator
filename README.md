##Description:
I coded this calculator to improve my coding skills, it's a calculator with a neat interface.

I used a black **CASIO HL-815L** style as an interface at the beginning, and it looked so pretty specially with the Form Reshaper code running, but removed the **CASIO** interface to avoid law infringement, it's against the law to share it afterall.

I never thought that coding a calculator would be so challenging and fun lol, I recommend you to check it.

I've done everything on a rush so it might contain bugs, please contact me if you find any.

I'm not a Photoshop expert and the interface I designed is a normal one so please contact me if you find/know any calculator image (a free one) so I could use it as an interface.

##Credits:
I've used **DIGITAL-7 Font by Style-7** on the LED -> ms-7@styleseven.com

I've used **[Form Reshaper - BitmapToRegion](http://www.vcskicks.com/custom_shape_form_region.php)** to make my form edges transperant.
